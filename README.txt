# MDM - Assignment 2: Static Website

This repository contains the project for Assignment 2 of the Web Development 2025 course.

## Project Description

This project is a static website that serves as a **Yu-Gi-Oh! Card Finder**. It allows users to search for cards by name or find a random card. All card data is fetched dynamically from the public YGOProDeck API.

## Features Implemented

* **Static Site:** The site is built using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
* **API Fetching:** Uses the `fetch` API to retrieve data from `https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api/v7/cardinfo.php`.
* **Dynamic Interaction:**
    * A search bar filters results in real-time.
    * A "Random Card" button fetches a random card and opens its details page.
* **CSS Animation:** Card results use a `mask-image` gradient to fade into the container background.
* **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to both desktop and mobile screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3 (Grid, Flexbox, Media Queries)
* JavaScript (ES6+)
